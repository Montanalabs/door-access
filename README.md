> **Ondos** — the injection-safe language. Here prompt injection isn't *detected*, it's
> *unrepresentable*: untrusted input must cross `extract<ClosedType>` before it can reach an
> effect. `check` proves it at compile time; the compiled binary re-clamps at run time.

# Door-access agent

Untrusted input is a credential; it can only ever become one of a fixed set of decisions over a
closed type, never a tool argument. An injected instruction cannot be represented in the
closed type, so it is rejected — proven at compile time by `check`, and clamped again at
run time by the `extract` domain check.

- **Untrusted input:** `fetch<web>` — a credential
- **Closed type:** `type Decision = Unlock(Door) | Deny` where `Door` is closed
- **Sink / capability:** `grant unlockDoor irreversible confidence 70` → `commit { unlockDoor(d) }`
- **Consequence axes:** Trust, Confidence, Reversibility

## Run the demo

```sh
examples/apps/door-access/demo.sh
```

The safe agent proves `SAFE`, runs on a benign input, and **rejects an injection
payload at the trust boundary (exit 3)**. The vulnerable version proves `UNSAFE` — it
never compiles to a runnable agent.

## Files

- `door-access_safe.wave` — the correct design.
- `door-access_unsafe.wave` — the tempting-but-wrong version (the negative example a model must learn to reject).
- `ondos.toml` — the project manifest (each app is a self-contained Ondos project).
